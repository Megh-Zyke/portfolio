            With a foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I specialize
            in developing captivating and user-friendly web applications. My
            expertise extends beyond web development, delving into the realm of
            machine learning where I leverage libraries like NumPy and Pandas
            for effective data manipulation, and TensorFlow for implementing
            advanced algorithms. With a keen eye for detail and a love for
            problem-solving, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality
            solutions. <br />
